# Token Character Artwork

Allows anyone to see an actor's artwork when they interact with its token. Pressing a keybind of your choice causes a popup to open with the character's artwork, as opposed to just an enlarged version of the token. At the moment only a couple types of click/shift-click are allowed; see the modules settings to select your preference.
