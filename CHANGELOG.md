# Token Character Artwork Change Log

## 1.1.0
* Updated for FoundryVTT 0.8.9.
* Now utilizes libWrapper.

## 1.0.1
* Change log created.
* Fixed issue where keybind didn't work on existing tokens until the scene was changed once after joining the server.
* Title of the artwork popup no longer shows the character's name unless the user has permission to see it. This checks on the token's name visibility setting as well as the actor's permission settings.
